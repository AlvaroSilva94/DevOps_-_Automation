Week 1: Linux & Shell Scripting

    Goal: Master basic Linux commands, shell scripting, and system administration tasks.

Day 1:

    Practice basic Linux commands: file manipulation (ls, cp, mv, rm), directory navigation (cd, pwd), and text processing (cat, grep, awk, sed).
    Task: Create a script that searches for a specific pattern in a set of log files.

Day 2:

    Focus on file permissions, process management (ps, top, kill), and disk usage commands (df, du).
    Task: Write a script that monitors a running process and restarts it if it stops.

Day 3:

    Learn basic networking commands (netstat, ping, curl, traceroute).
    Task: Write a script to check the connectivity of a list of IP addresses or URLs.

Day 4:

    Study crontab and automate simple tasks using cron jobs.
    Task: Set up a cron job to run a backup script daily.

Day 5:

    Practice advanced text processing with awk, sed, and regular expressions.
    Task: Create a script that extracts error messages from a log file and saves them to a separate file.

Day 6 & 7:

    Review: Revisit the scripts you wrote, refactor them for efficiency, and add comments. Try to understand how you can optimize your code.

Week 2: Version Control (Git) & CI/CD Concepts

    Goal: Get comfortable with Git and CI/CD tools like Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or GitLab CI.

Day 1:

    Learn basic Git commands: clone, commit, push, pull, branch, merge, rebase.
    Task: Simulate a Git workflow with branches: create a feature branch, make changes, and merge it back.

Day 2:

    Study Git conflict resolution.
    Task: Create a merge conflict on purpose and practice resolving it.

Day 3:

    Introduction to CI/CD pipelines.
    Task: Set up a simple pipeline on GitHub Actions or GitLab CI to build and test a basic project.

Day 4:

    Explore setting up jobs for automated testing.
    Task: Modify the pipeline to include unit tests for a sample application.

Day 5:

    Learn to add deployment steps in CI/CD.
    Task: Add a step to your CI/CD pipeline to deploy to a development environment.

Day 6 & 7:

    Review: Go through your CI/CD pipelines and make sure you understand each step. Experiment with different triggers and conditions.

Week 3: Containerization (Docker) & Orchestration (Kubernetes)

    Goal: Gain practical experience with Docker and Kubernetes basics.

Day 1:

    Learn Docker basics: images, containers, volumes, and networks.
    Task: Create a Dockerfile for a simple web application.

Day 2:

    Practice Docker Compose for multi-container setups.
    Task: Set up a Docker Compose file for a basic web application and database.

Day 3:

    Introduction to Kubernetes: pods, deployments, and services.
    Task: Deploy your Dockerized application to a local Kubernetes cluster (like Minikube).

Day 4:

    Learn about Kubernetes configuration management: ConfigMaps and Secrets.
    Task: Create a Kubernetes deployment that uses ConfigMaps for environment variables.

Day 5:

    Practice scaling and updating applications in Kubernetes.
    Task: Scale your deployment and roll out updates using rolling deployments.

Day 6 & 7:

    Review: Experiment with failure scenarios in Kubernetes, like killing pods and observing auto-recovery.

Week 4: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) & Cloud Platforms

    Goal: Get familiar with IaC tools like Terraform and cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, or Azure).

Day 1:

    Learn basic Terraform: providers, resources, and state management.
    Task: Write a Terraform script to provision an EC2 instance on AWS or a VM on GCP.

Day 2:

    Study variables, outputs, and modules in Terraform.
    Task: Refactor your script to use variables and outputs.

Day 3:

    Explore cloud networking basics: VPCs, subnets, security groups.
    Task: Modify your Terraform script to set up networking components.

Day 4:

    Introduction to AWS CloudFormation or Azure ARM templates.
    Task: Create a simple stack with CloudFormation (or equivalent on Azure).

Day 5:

    Learn about monitoring and logging: AWS CloudWatch, Prometheus, or ELK stack.
    Task: Set up a basic monitoring solution for your deployed infrastructure.

Day 6 & 7:

    Review: Ensure you understand the IaC code you wrote and explore ways to improve or extend it.
